# CrazySums APC

This project was developed as part of the APC (Algorithms and Computer Programming) course. It is a terminal-based game written in C, inspired by the classic Number Sums game.

##About the Game
In this game, players are challenged to solve number-based puzzles by combining numbers to reach a target sum. The objective is to improve mathematical and problem-solving skills through progressively difficult levels.

##Features
- Simple and intuitive terminal interface
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Score tracking

##Installation
To compile and run the game, ensure you have a C compiler installed. You can use gcc to compile the code as follows:
```
gcc -o CrazySums CrazySums.c
./CrazySums
```
##How to Play
You will be given a list of numbers and a target sum.
Combine numbers from the list to reach the target sum.
Enter your solution and the game will validate it.
Progress through the levels as you solve more puzzles!

##Requirements
C compiler (e.g., GCC)
